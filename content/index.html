    <h1>Welcome to Hyattsville's Watershed Implementation Plan</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Hyattsville municipal government would like to create a resource for their residents to refer to regarding watershed implementation to manage stormwater flooding and river pollution. The city has conducted studies and implemented several management plans in the area, but would like to have this information also displayed on their website for residents to refer to. This plan will be especially valuable to the residents of Hyattsville after recent storms have flooded the city.</p>

      <p>Our objective is to host educational infographics for Hyattsville residents that makes information regarding watershed issues and concerns in their city easily accessible and understandable. Hyattsville will be one of the first municipalities to develop their own implementation plan. Their plan will be based off of current Prince George’s County and Maryland state’s watershed implementation plans for the Chesapeake Bay area, and will be customized to fit their needs.</p>
