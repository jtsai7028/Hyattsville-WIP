      <h1>Precipitation</h1>

      <div class="description">
        <p>An average person uses 109,500 gallons of water per year. The city of Hyattsville has 18,243 thus uses 1.9 billion gallons of water a year. If we can implement the Watershed Implementation Plan, we can save up to 1.79 billion gallons of water a year just from rainwater alone. If we are able to conserve this much water, it will also likely decrease the water bill for the average citizen up to 94%, turning a $100 water bill to a $6 water bill.</p>

        <p>The current rainfall of 1.79 billion gallons ends up in the sewers and in the streams and rivers; but on the way, the water picks up pollutants. When that part of water reaches the Anacostia watershed, it becomes so polluted that it is unsafe for people to touch.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Rainwater</dt>
          <dd>Water that has not collected soluble material from the solid and is therefore naturally "soft" (it contains less dissolved minerals).</dd>

          <dt>Stormwater</dt>
          <dd>Water that originates from rain, including snow and icemelt, but is not exactly "rainwater".  Stormwater drains off of land area after rainfall, and is considered "hard" water by collecting minerals such as chalk, lime, magnesium, and calcium, as it becomes runoff.  Stormwater includes water stored in ponds and puddles, and evaporated water.</dd>

          <dt>Drinking water</dt>
          <dd>Also known as potable water, it is safe for drinking and food preparation.  Both soft and hard water can be used as drinking water.</dd>
