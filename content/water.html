      <h1>Water Quality Standards</h1>

      <div class="description">
        <p>Our audience should be aware of the significance of our data, as it is crucial to know where the Hyattsville township is attaining its water from. Our audience cares deeply about water cleanliness and minerals and deserves to know nearby water sources’ locations. Continuing, it’s crucial that our audience is aware that cryptosporidium, a lethal pathogen, is luckily not found in Hyattsville’s water sources.</p>

        <p>Regulated contaminants present in water consist of barium, fluoride, nitrate, copper, and residual chlorine. Other chemicals found in water include chloroform, a bacteriological contamination, and manganese and sodium, two detected unregulated contaminants. The WSSC drinking water undergoes extensive purification and treatment before it is distributed to its Hyattsville constituents. Not only is this process quite extensive, it includes specific water filtration processes, such as coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and UV treatment.</p>
